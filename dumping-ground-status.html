        </figcaption>Our land waste water dumping site is situated at a distance of
        300 metres from the factory location.
        The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are costly and are used for dumping of
        those
        wastewater only that are to be left on open surface in low lying lands to serve as landfills.
        We tend to deliver wastewater rich in solid waste to these open surface land dumping.
        </p>
        <p>
            The underground dumping site is also situated at the same location. But the waste water is transported by
            pipelines.
            They are released at the required spots underground. The locatioin is so chosen where the land is barren
            and the water content in the soil is somewhat less. Overtime, the fertility and quality of these sites will
            improve
            we shall open cooperative sugar-cane industry on open land and shift entirely to undergrounddumping as then
            open
            surface dumping would pose a problem.

        <p>
        <address>Arambol, Goa.</address>Our sea waste water dumping site is situated at a distance of 68 kilometres from
        the
        factory location.
        The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are very costly but we cant find a
        substitute
        for them.
        Being at a sea beach dumping site, pipelines network wont serve the purpose. The sandy ground is not fit for
        supporting pipelines and so tankers are the last scope.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sea dumping site is also situated far away from the factory location.
            Only the best trated wastewaters are released into the sea. The locatioin is so chosen where the high tides
            are
            less
            and the water content is somewhat less. Overtime, the area will become worse than the present, as all that
            goes
            to sea is
            all that will go to the atmosphere and all that would fall to us as rain. To practice sustainable sea waste
            water dumping,
            we urge all the <a href="active-citizen.html">citizens to become aware and reduce the contamination of water
                at
                the
                primary stage.

        The waste water is transported to the dumping site via tankers. They are very costly but we cant find a
        substitute

        Being at a laterite dumping site, pipelines network won't serve the purpose. The sandy ground is not fit for

            level
            is less.
            Overtime, the area will become worse than the present, as all that goes to river eventually enters sea, and
            all
            that
            goes to sea is
